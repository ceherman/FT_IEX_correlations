## CADET
- Used to discover and validate the Graetz number correlation

## Retentivity data
- Consilidated literature data that were used to discover the correlation between stoichiometric displacement model (SDM) parameters
- Also contains attempts to reproduce the SDM parameter correlation from mean-field and discrete-charge electrostatics models

## Writing
- Scripts used during LaTeX compilation
